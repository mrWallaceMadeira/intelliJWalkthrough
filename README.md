# IntelliJ & GitHub: BFFS &nbsp; :two_men_holding_hands:
Yesterday you were introduced to IntelliJ, GitHub & git.\
Today, I'll walk you through **how** we're going to use these tools this mod.

### Main workflows
###### Starting a new lab
We've already set up our Mod1Labs _repo_ (:eyes:&nbsp; new vocab!) on our computers and linked it to GitHub.\
Which leaves us with only a few steps to get started on each new lab...
  - [x] Open your Mod1Labs IntelliJ folder
  - [x] Create a new Java Class & edit the configurations properly
  - [x] Find the associated instructions / starter code in my [Mod1Labs repo](https://github.com/mrWallaceMadeira/Mod1Labs)
  - [x] Copy/Paste into your new class & start `coding`
  
Watch [TODO]() for a visual respresentation of&nbsp;:arrow_up:

###### Starting a new project from scratch (i.e. challenge problems)
To create an entirely new GitHub repo, we'll have to re-trace our steps from [yesterday's setup guide].
  - Follow the steps titled "Creating your first IntelliJ project" and "Connecting your IntelliJ project to GitHub"
Once you've created a new repo, named Mod1Challenge, par exemple, follow the above steps replacing Mod1Labs with Mod1Challenge

###### Saving stuff (
Unfortunately, we don't have the lovely autosave functions of Microsoft Word in the programming world.\
We are stuck with git.\
Think of git like your grandpa. He doesn't hear well & definitely needs to be told exactly how to execute each step.\
Using the git-grandpa model, there are 3 basic tasks our git-grandpa can do: 
  - [x] prepare new files for saving with `git add`
    - Yes, a ridiculous step, I agree. It's like if grandpa-git has to move a book from the floor to shelf number 3, he's gotta pause at shelf 2 to rest.
  - [x] save new files with `git commit`
  - [x] share new files with Mr.Wallace & the Internet (new band name?) with `git push`
