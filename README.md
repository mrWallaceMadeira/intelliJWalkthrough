# IntelliJ & GitHub: BFFS &nbsp; :couple:
Yesterday you were introduced to IntelliJ.\
Wikipedia tells me that: "IntelliJ IDEA is an integrated development environment (IDE) written in Java for developing computer software."\

###### An analogy
IntelliJ is to writing Java code and Microsoft Word is to writing english papers


### A look at the interface
Watch [TODO]() to get an overview of the IntelliJ's bells & whistles.
